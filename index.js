// Reverse

/* Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. 
The reversed array should have the same length, 
with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. 
Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second 
array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. 
As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice(). */

//We set a temp variable to hold the value of the current index we are on.
//We then set the current index to the value of the index at the end of the array.
//We then set the value of the index at the end of the array to the value of the temp variable.
//We then return the array.
